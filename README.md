# Madlibs Gen

# This is one of my projects for my portfolio
### This is going to be a Mad Lib Generator
### This is also for my Codecademy Full-Stack Course

# What it will do
- Create a new message kinda base on Mad Libs
- You will give a Adjective, Verb, and a Noun.
- It will create a randomly generated message including the adjective/verb/noun.

# How to use
- Run it using Node.js
- Open up the terminal and type: node index.js
- You can either add your own words or you can you my predetermined words.
- I have got 15 different sentence to go through the words at random and input them into the templates.

# Things that helped me accomplish this
- Codecademy Forums
- Google

# What i had learned from this project
- I alot of fun learning about readline syntax it helped me
get an interface and process the input and output.
- Making the input code was fun and i really like how it turned out i do think that
i could add some inprovements maybe ill comeback to it one day and add more or hey when i
know alot more things make it all fancy C:

# Side Note
